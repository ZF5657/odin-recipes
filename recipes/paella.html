    <h1>Paella</h1>
    <img src="../images/paella.jpg">
    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>I absolutely love paella. I love what it embodies and the cultural significance behind it. What I mean by that is, the importance of gathering with others. Paella is meant to be shared and enjoyed with friends and family. Enjoying a delicious and filling meal paired with good wine and good company - there's nothing quite like it. That, and you won't eat yourself sick like you would with pasta. I wanted to include this because while it can be time-consuming, it is well worth the effort. There are many different traditional ways to make paella in different regions of spain. What us Americans, and likely other regions, picture paella with mussels, cuttlefish and/or octopus, shrimp, and sausage in a bed of rice with chopped onions and peppers. While no doubt better than the simplified version of this page, the simple version takes less time and is much more difficult to mess up.</p>
    <p>A brief history: Spainish culture is deeply ingrained in Arabic and North African culture with the Moors once inhabiting the Iberian Penninsula. The Moors in Muslim Spain started cultivating rice around the 10th century. Given the location and culture, dishes included seafood and rich spices, which was then enjoyed with family gatherings and religious feasts. After the 15th century, cooks would customarily combine rice with beans and vegetables. This Spanish dish is a perfect illustration of the cultural union between Roman and Arab, Catholic and Muslim societies.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    To keep things organized and manageable, the below ingredients will be organized into what is needed for the marinade and the paella.
    <h4>Marinade</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Olive oil: 2 tbsp</li>
