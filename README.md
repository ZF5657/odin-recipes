The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my knowledge of HTML thus far and to apply that knowledge into a tangible, working webpage. I also need to display proper directory organization, code formatting, and standard practice commit notes that are easy to read and understand. While I will be revisiting this page to enhance with my future CSS knowledge, I want to make this webpage look as nice and organized as possible.

Having completed the HTML portion of this project, I think it turned out alright. I am sure there might be a typo somewhere I missed and probably made some errors in my directory naming as well as my commit comments that go against standard practices. That being said, I like what I have done so far and hope to improve this further. I enjoyed practicing and learning more about Git, GitHub, and the many conveniences of VS code. I also enojoyed reading up about the different recipes' historical and cultural significance. I realized I have come a long way in cooking; I wrote down the directions for the fettuccine alfredo from memory and experience. I don't have any experience with making lasagna and minimal with paella, so I liked learning more about how to make those.
My interest in coding has certainly grown after this and I am excited to continue my journey into becoming a full stack developer. I am sure I will improve my commit comments and standard practices with time.
